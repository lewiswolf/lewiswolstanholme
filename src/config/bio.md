Lewis is a multidisciplinary artist and musician based in London. His practice centres around contemporary approaches to composition, installation and performance, utilising his technological capabilities to develop new techniques towards exploratory sound design and experimental performativity. Together with Francis Devine, Lewis curates the audiovisual performance project Julia Set, specialising in crossmodal, immersive and improvisatory art practices. As a duo, their outputs lie between the realms of music and the fine arts, with works that aim to challenge a spectatorâ€™s perceptive interpretation of the audible and visual world. As this project has developed, they have also collaborated with numerous other artists to produce works that push the boundaries of both contemporary music and performative technology. Julia Set has previously produced and released several of their audiovisual pieces online, curated numerous performances across the UK, and have worked alongside labels such as Nonclassical and State51.

Lewis is currently working as a part-time PhD researcher in Electronic Engineering & Computer Science at the Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London. Prior to this, he received his BMus and MMus in composition from Goldsmiths, University of London, whilst focusing primarily on experimental composition, microtonal music and aesthetics. Now working as part of the Augmented Instruments Lab alongside Andrew McPherson, Lewis' research is centred upon compositional and computational approaches to percussion instruments. This topic encompasses a practice based approach towards the development of technology, primarily engendering the artistic employment of fictional percussion instruments, synthesised via the means of physical modelling. As part of this process driven narrative, this research has brought about the development of technologies relating to the orchestration of percussion instruments, interfaces for the exploration of synthesised percussive instruments, as well as the augmentation of traditional percussion instruments to achieve new sonic and performative ideals. This approach to research has highlighted several philosophical frictions embedded within the relationship between science and art, innate amongst the contemporary challenges surrounding a work that spans across multiple disciplines.

<!-- Aside from his own endeavours, Lewis works as a freelance art worker, offering both curatorial and technological support to artists.
spatial audio, software development, AI, web design
Alongside his technical work, Lewis also specialises in engraving, preparing scores and parts for performance and publication. -->
