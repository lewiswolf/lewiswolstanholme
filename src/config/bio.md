Lewis is a multidisciplinary artist and musician based in London. Together with Francis Devine, Lewis curates the audiovisual performance project Julia Set. Although focused primarily on engendering immersive sound and visual experiences, Julia Set draws most of their influence from contemporary classical music and the fine arts.

Lewis is currently working as a PhD researcher in artificial intelligence and music at the Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London. Prior to this, he received his BMus and MMus in composition from Goldsmiths, University of London, whilst focusing primarily on experimental composition practices, microtonal music and aesthetics. Now working as part of the Augmented Instruments Lab alongside Andrew McPherson, Lewis' research centres around creating compositional and performative tools for working with arbitrarily shaped drums. Arbitrarily shaped drums are a fictional family of 2-dimensional percussion instruments. Lewis' approach to this research hinges primarily on creative practice as research, enveloping a narrative surrounding the development and exploration of computer software as a means of creating contemporary art.

Aside from all of this, Lewis works as a freelance engraver, preparing scores and parts for performance and publication.
