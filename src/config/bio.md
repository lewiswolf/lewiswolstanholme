Lewis is a musician and creative coder living and working in London. Together with Francis Devine, Lewis curates the audiovisual performance project Julia Set. Although focused primarily on engendering immersive sound and visual experiences, Julia Set draws most of their influence from contemporary classical music and the fine arts.

Lewis is currently studying towards his PhD in artificial intelligence and music at the Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London, prior to which he received his BMus and MMus in composition from Goldsmiths, University of London. Now working as part of the Augmented Instruments Lab, alongside Andrew McPherson, Lewis' research focuses on creating compositional and performative tools for working with arbitrarily shaped drums. Arbitrarily shaped drums are a fictional family of 2-dimensional percussion instruments. Lewis' approach to this research hinges primarily on creative practice as research, enveloping a narrative surrounding the development and exploration of computer software as a means of creating contemporary art.

Aside from all of this, Lewis works both as a freelance engraver, preparing scores and parts for performance and publication, and as a private tutor, mentoring students in piano, composition and programming techniques.
