Lewis is a multidisciplinary artist and musician based in London.
His practice centres around contemporary approaches to composition, installation and performance, utilising his technological capabilities to develop new techniques towards exploratory sound design and experimental performativity.
Lewis curates the audiovisual performance project Julia Set, specialising in crossmodal, immersive and improvisatory art practices.
Julia Set's output lies between the realms of music and the fine arts, with works that aim to challenge a spectator’s perceptive interpretation of the audible and visual world.
As this project has developed, Lewis has collaborated with a variety of other artists to create works that reinforce his aesthetic dialogue with performative technology and explorative production.
Julia Set have previously released several of their audiovisual pieces online, curated numerous performances across the UK and Europe, and have worked alongside labels such as Nonclassical and State51.

Lewis is currently a part-time PhD researcher in Electronic Engineering & Computer Science at the Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London.
Prior to this, he received his BMus and MMus in composition from Goldsmiths, University of London, whilst focusing primarily on microtonal composition and performance, experimental music production and contemporary aesthetics.
Now working as part of the Augmented Instruments Lab alongside Andrew McPherson, Lewis' research is centred upon material fictions, exploring compositional and computational approaches to abstract sound design.
This topic encompasses a practice based approach towards the development of sonic technologies, including the orchestration of abstract percussion instruments, interfaces for the exploration of synthesised and physically modelled instruments, as well as the augmentation of traditional percussion instruments to achieve new performative ideals.
This process driven narrative has also encouraged research into spatial audio and other forms of synthesis technologies, as well as highlighted several philosophical frictions embedded within the relationship between science and art.

Lewis works as a freelancer across multiple artistic and specialist disciplines.
Lewis has assisted artists in a variety of settings, most prominently providing musical, technical and audio engineering support to artists during performance and production.
Lewis has developed award winning synthesisers, as well as various audio tools for artists including web applications, tools for working with spatial audio, as well as audio effects for bespoke musical environments.
These activities include being the principal technician for Andrew McPherson's magnetic resonator piano, providing tailored musical and technical support for artists in both studio and live performance contexts.
Similarly, Lewis has developed a suite of multichannel audio effects for the company Submarine Pickups, providing artists with an explorative approach to designing sounds with hexaphonic guitar pickups.
He has also engaged in a range of work as an engraver, preparing scores for publication and performance.
Throughout these activities, Lewis has worked with artists such as Arca, BBC Symphony Orchestra, Graham Fitkin, Gwilym Gold, Jon Brion, Pet Shop Boys, Pulp, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Sound Intermedia, The Vernon Spring, Xenia Pestova Bennett and many others.

As an educator, Lewis has worked as a studio manager and lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, and is also a Max Certified Trainer.
During this time, Lewis has designed and taught the courses Sound Design, a BSc module which covers the practice of sound design using Max, and Sound Recording & Production Techniques, an MSc module focused on the practices of music production using Ableton Live.
Outside of Queen Mary, Lewis has hosted lectures and workshops at a number of institutions covering the use of Max as a performing artist.
Lewis' approach to education is reflexive towards the student, a practice which he developed during the early parts of his career when he worked as a peripatetic piano and composition tutor.
